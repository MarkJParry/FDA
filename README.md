# Overview
The **pyplot** notebook demonstrates the matplotlib pyplot package in python. It provides a quick overview of what is available in the package, how to use it, brief explanations of their purpose, illustrations of their use and where to go for further information.  

The **cao** notebook provides an analysis of CAO points data. The years 2019, 2020 and 2021 are downloaded, combined and analysed. It illustrates how to download and read html,excel and pdf files, as well as how to combine them into a pandas dataframe for analysis. The analysis is then presented using graphical illustrations and tables,  inferences and conclusions are then discussed.
